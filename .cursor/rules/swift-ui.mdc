SwiftUI UI Design Rules:

Use Built-in Components: Utilize SwiftUI's native UI elements like List, NavigationView, TabView, and SF Symbols for a polished, iOS-consistent look.

Master Layout Tools: Employ VStack, HStack, ZStack, Spacer, and Padding for responsive designs; use LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid for grids; GeometryReader for dynamic layouts.
